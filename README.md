This project focuses on addressing key challenges faced by the copper industry, particularly in the areas of sales prediction and lead classification. By leveraging machine learning techniques, we aim to improve decision-making processes and streamline operations in this sector.

Problem Statement :
The copper industry deals with sales and pricing data that often suffer from skewness and noise, impacting the accuracy of manual predictions. Additionally, efficiently capturing and classifying leads is crucial for business success. To tackle these challenges, we propose building two machine learning models:

Regression Model: Predicts the selling price of copper products, considering factors such as quantity, customer, country, and product specifications.
Classification Model: Evaluates and classifies leads as either successful (WON) or unsuccessful (LOST) based on various attributes.

Approach :
Data Understanding:
Identify variable types and distributions.
Treat rubbish values and encode categorical variables appropriately.
Data Preprocessing:
Handle missing values.
Treat outliers using Interquartile Range (IQR) or Isolation Forest.
Address skewness through appropriate transformations.
Encode categorical variables using suitable techniques.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Visualize outliers and skewness.
Explore relationships between variables.
Feature Engineering:
Create new features if applicable.
Drop highly correlated columns.
Model Building and Evaluation:
Split dataset into training and testing sets.
Train and evaluate regression and classification models using various algorithms.
Optimize model hyperparameters through cross-validation and grid search.
Model GUI with Streamlit:
Develop an interactive web application using Streamlit.
Allow users to input data and predict selling prices or lead statuses.
Learning Outcomes
This project offers valuable learning experiences in:

Python programming and data analysis libraries.
